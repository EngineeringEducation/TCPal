## why hello there

fancy seeing you here!

this is an iOS companion app for the tradecraft experience. it's pretty cool. so far its swanky features include:

- pretty basic announcements from the server
- a data archive! mostly just an idea.
- a symbol of helpfulness to design track.
- a game for identifying faces. a "face game"
- a contact list. tap on people to see... the people. (ios9 only)

right now this is a "bring your own data" scene. that's cool, just slack janardan and he'll give you the sample data, it's just best not to put that kind of thing in git in case we open this at some point.

that's all. cheerio
