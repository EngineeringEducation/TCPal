## why hello there

fancy seeing you here!

this is an iOS companion app for the tradecraft experience. it's pretty cool. so far its swanky features include:

- stuff happening today ... uh ... or the idea of that
- a game for identifying faces. a "face game"
- a contact list. tap on people to see... the people.

um, except right now you have to supply your own data. that's cool, just slack janardan and he'll give you the sample data, it's just best not to put that kind of thing in git in case we open this at some point.

that's all. cheerio
